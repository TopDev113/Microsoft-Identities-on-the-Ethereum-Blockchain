To Run: 
truffle compile
truffle migrate  (genache need to be running at this time)
npm run start




Steps for if it is needed to re-deploy contract on blockchain
The way we use in truffle.js is using Infura API (which is a handy service that allow us to deploy like Geth but without having actual geth and a full synced node)
First get a passphrase of the wallet account (the one for deploy) (We will secretly share the wallet secret phrase offline (NEVER PUSH PASSPHRASE to git/public domain))
Under truffle.js modify the variable passphrase from <secret passphrase of the deployment wallet> to proper passphrases (ex: betray apple car newyork ...)
Run truffle compile
Run truffle migrate --network rinkeby (Make sure the wallet you use in step 3. has enough Eth to deploy the contract, otherwise it will fail)
Wait the process to complete.
To verify the deployment of the contract in build/contracts/<target contract> (Same as the teacher's instructions) that "networks" has proper values set in (address, txn hashes, network ids ...etc)
Done
